# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews (Micro-Portfolio)

This project demonstrates the process of text annotation for sentiment analysis, a critical task for understanding customer feedback and improving business operations.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** To analyze and label a dataset of 200 e-commerce customer reviews, categorizing each one with a sentiment of `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.

**Tools & Format:**
- **Annotation Tool:** Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets
- **Output Format:** A clean CSV file with a new `sentiment` column.

This project showcases the ability to interpret nuanced human language, apply a consistent labeling rubric, and deliver a clean, analysis-ready dataset. A key part of the process was developing a clear rule for handling missing data (blank reviews were labeled as `neutral`).

## Sample Labeled Data

Here is a small sample of the final annotated data:

| Review Text | Rating | Sentiment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Absolutely love this dress! The fabric is so soft and comfortable." | 5 | positive |
| "The material felt cheap and the fit was very unflattering. I returned it." | 2 | negative |
| "The color is a bit different than the picture, but it's okay." | 3 | neutral |
| "" | 4 | neutral |
